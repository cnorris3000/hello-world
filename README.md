# Hello-GitHub

My name is Chris Norris;

I have been around the sun almost 32 times now (as of this typing).

I have a military background, an AAS in Baking and Pastry Arts,
  and I can make you a Chocolate Cake that will literally ruin
  all other chocolate cakes for you for the rest of your entire life.
  
I also almost finished a Bachelor's of Science in software dev:
  My GI Bill ran out of money.
  
So for years now I've been studying and trying to learn as much as I can,
  as best as I can, without a mentor; and ultimately without practicing
  what I have learned in a manner that can prove knowledge gained over time.
  
So, here I am;
  Ready to do this!
